# Toxic-Comment-Classification
Challenge is to build a multi-headed model that’s capable of detecting different types of of toxicity like threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate. Data comprises of comments from Wikipedia’s talk page edits.
Approaches:- 
* There are 2 approaches used for it.
    * Basic LogisticRegression using words and characters ngrams.
    * Using Deep Learning BiLSTM and using Glove embeddings. Below is the explanation for BiLSTM, Glove embeddings approach.

I will be explaining second approach below as this gave me best results and is something new to try out.

Approach:-
* Preprocess data
    * Remove null column values by any textual data as I did by using "fillna" in my code.                  
* Select number of features, max length and embedding to use
    * max_features = 100000, maxlen = 150, embedding used = Glove
* Use Tokenizer to tokenize text, convert them to sequences and pad the comments so that each one becomes = maxlen of 150 words.
* Used Glove embedding to create embeddings of words which are in vocabulary.
* Create model
    * Take Input of shape = maxlen
    * Create Embedding layer of max_features
    * Apply SpatialDropout
    * Use Bidirectional LSTM with 128 layers.
    * Apply Conv1D and reduced the number of layers to 64.
    * Apply GlobalAveragePooling1D and GlobalMaxPooling1D and concatenate them.
    * Apply Dropout
    * Use Dense Layer with activation as sigmoid
* Compile the model with 'binary_crossentropy'.
* Fit the model and run for 5 epochs(after that it converges).
* Perform k fold with number of folds = 4.

For running code
* Download Input files used https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SaPn9Ccn4dLYZq-dqBXVysoyA5v19s7i
* Install Keras
* Run ```download.sh``` to download glove embeddings.
* Run ```jupyter notebook Toxic_code_LSTM.ipynb```.
